# Hangman
Python hangman game

In order to run, python 3 and tkinter are required.

The only thing you have to do is run the "hangman.py" file and the game begins.

The code is platform independent. The only thing plaatform dependent code is required is when tkinter and sentry-sdk need to be installed.

# Tkinter
Tkinter is being used for the graphics user interface (aka gui)

#Sentry-SDK
Sentry sdk is being used for error reporting.
